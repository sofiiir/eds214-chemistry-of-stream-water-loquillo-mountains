# Exceeds Spec

## The code is appropriately commented

The code is adequately commented and allows for reproducibility by showing step by step how the analysis and construction of the graph were completed. The comments are informative but do not over jumble the code. The comments were also formatted with ARTofR where appropriate.

## At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file.

The moving average function is in its own script in the R folder. Roxygen was included to explain its use and parameters. Data cleaning, 9 week average calculations, and ggplotting also all have their own scripts.

# Collaboration

In reviewing Leela's repository I opened issues for specs that were not yet met. I created an environment initialization r script in her project to contribute.
