# Hurricane Effects on the Chemistry of Stream Water in the Loquillo Mountains Watershed, Puerto Rico

This repository includes the code used to replicate the analysis of nutrients present in four water sheds in the Loquillo Mountain Watershed. The final goal is to recreate a visual of the four watersheds nutrient levels depicting nutrient levels before and after 1989 Hurricane Hugo.

## Data

Raw data is stored in the data folder as individual files for each of the four watersheds being analyzed. The processed data was read in and processed for the necessary data to produce the final figure and can be found in the output folder.

Raw data can also be downloaded through the [EDI Data Portal](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-luq.20.4923064).
