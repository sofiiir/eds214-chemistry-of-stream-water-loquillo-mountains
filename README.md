# Hurricane Effects on the Chemistry of Stream Water in the Loquillo Mountains Watershed, Puerto Rico


This repository includes the code used to replicate the analysis of four water sheds in the Loquillo Mountain Watershed. The final goal is to recreate a visual of the four watersheds nutrient levels both before and after 1989 Hurricane Hugo.

## Data

Data is stored in the data folder as individual files for each of the four watersheds being analyzed. The data is read in and processed for the necessary data to produce the final figure.

Raw data can also be downloaded through the [EDI Data Portal](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-luq.20.4923064) from the publication of the original
